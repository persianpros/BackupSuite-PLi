- Message from Pedro Newbie:
TO ALL USERS

I stop the development and maintenance of the BackupSuite due to personal circumstances. I have found Persian Prince willing to take over the task from me.
Thank you for all the positive reactions I received in the past.
I assume that the BackupSuite is in good hands with Persian Prince.
I do not completely disappear from the satellite scene so you will see me regularly on the Openpli forum

Thanks for all the support and trust in me.

Pedro(_newbie)

- WWIO BRE2ZE 4K support
- Corrected some space into tabs in the above mentioned additions
- Changed the plugin.py to accept the above mentioned editions and changed detection of the VU+ 4k models
PLEASE NOTE: The file plugin.py still needs some checking on the flash-part, I don't know if the new additions are already flashable in the plugin! I lack time to check it all.

Thanks Athoik

Git 138

Git 136
- Added support for the Spycat Mini Plus, Formuler F4 Turbo and Zgemma I 55

Git 135
- Added support for the Edision OS mega

Git 134
- Again a small alteration in scanning for suitable locations for the USB version. On certain mounts the calculated size was wrong.
If the file 'backupstick' is present in the root of one of the mounts it is possible to make a backup on that mount via the yellow button: 
Backup > USB

Git 133
- Very small alteration in scanning for suitable backup locations for the usb version

Git 132

Git 128
- Some changes because Betacentauri adapted the binary ofgwrite to facilitate the HD51

Git 123+124
- Reworked the routine for the Mutant HD51. In the former version the possibility existed that the made backup was not complete. 
Now the backup is made of the whole partition and then it's compressed in rootfs.tar.bz2 format.

The backup can ONLY be restored using the BackupSuite -> Blue button (=Restore backup). 
It can't be flashed by the USB-stick.

Thanks go to Betacentauri which pointed me to the possible problems and gave me some guidance to the solution!

It's still work in progress so it could be that in (short) term there will be more changes.
Please test and report back if there are any issues (or if everthing goes like intended!)

Git 122
- Added support for the Mutant HD51. The Backupsuite makes a backup in the disk.img format. Don't use it in a multiboot configuration!
This is the first release for the HD51 and is still work in progress, so use with care.
The backup made can't be restored via the blue button in the Backupsuite. The backup has to be restored by flashing it via USB just like a new image.

- Added support for the Xsarius Pure HD

Git 100
It seems that not every one knows the difference between a file and a folder, so for the making of a backup on an USB-stick there is a check on the existence of a file with the text pattern backupstick in the name, now the check is also done on folders!
So if a file or a folder is found on the USB-stick with the text pattern backupstick in the name then the USB-stick is valid.

Git 99
- Merged pull request by Dimitrij: add support dual boot (et8500)

Git 96
- Merged pull request from Athoik which added support for the Edison OSmini

Git 93
- Added support for the HD1500

Git 92
Some big changes, at first now it is possible to maintain your backups from the plugin.
With the blue button you are now able to delete the backups you want to get rid of.
Please bear in mind that this only works for the backups created with this or any newer version of the BackupSuite.
If you want to be able to do this also for your older backups then you'll have to move the files:
imageversion and BackupSuite.log 
from the data folder to the folder above (in the folder right under the folder /fullbackup_<model/<date_time>/ )
Big thanks to Tension for the changes!

Also debugged a bit for the Solo4k, now you should be able to make a backup of the image in the Solo4k. 
There is still some work to do but for now it should work.
PLEASE REMEMBER: 
The Solo4k backup can't be restored by the BackupSuite using the ofgwrite utility (yet).
Thanks Findex for doing some testing with his Solo4k!

Git 91
- Added support for the Zgemma 
Star S / Star 2S
H5
H.S / H.2S / H.2H

Git 90
- Added support for the upcoming Golden Interstar LX Class S2 and C

Git 89
- Back to normal screens

Git 88
Happy New Year!

Git 87
It is for me near impossible to add all enigma2 receivers on the market, just by the lack of time and missing the inside information about the receivers. 
Therefore I added the ability to maintain your own lookuptable.txt in /etc.
If you want to add a receiver which isn't supported by me, just copy the lookuptable.txt to /etc and edit this table with the right parameters.
The file lookuptable.txt in /etc is safe for updates so you can build your own list with supported receivers.
If you place the file lookuptable.txt in /etc this file will be the one that's used to create the back-up's.
If there is no file in /etc then the standard file supplied by the BackupSuite is used.
If you want a certain receiver to be supported just ask the image maker to add a lookuptable.txt in the folder /etc or ask for the parameters to be used.

Git 86
- Did some overdue maintenance on plugin.py concerning the VU+ models

Git 85
- Added support for the VU+ Solo 4K. Beware: this is a very early test, the plugin still needs some tidying up.
Don't try to flash the made back-up of the Solo 4k with the built in OFGWRITE, it needs an update to be able to flash the Solo 4K
Reverted the truncating of the kernelpartition

Git 84
- Added seasons greetings

Git 83
- Added support for the Xsarius Fusion HD SE
- Corrected the extra path for the Xsarius HD

Git 82
- Completed support for the Xsarius Fusion HD (at the moment still no confirmation if it functions), looking for some owners of a Fusion who would like to test it and report if all is functioning as it should.
- Removed the support for unknown devices.

Git 81
- Added support for Xsarius Fusion HD (very experimental, use with care!)

Git 80
- Temporary measure: bail out if the receiver is a VU+ Solo 4K until more is known what the requirements are to make a working back-up
Lookuptable expanded with the entry Solo4K

Git 78 & 79
- Git 78 has been canceled/reverted by Git 79

Git 77
- Removed some obsolete code, this were some remains of experiments which I overlooked

Git 76
- Made some alterations in the way a back-up is made: if a backup is made onto the harddisk there is no longer a flashable copy made in the root of the harddisk. The backup is only stored in the folder "fullbackup_<type> etc.
If the backup is made onto an USB-stick then the copy is made in the root and a copy in the folder fullbackup_<type> etc.

Git 75
- Very small change in handling/reporting unknown device

Git 74
- Very small change in selecting the correct model from the list

Git 73
- Added some kind of support for unknown receivers. If the receiver is not found in the lookuptable the program won't be aborted but a backup will be made with some standard file naming. The user has at least to rename the folder where the backup is made.
Highly experimental but it is worth a go.
WTE gave me the idea to read some necessities from the receiver. Thanks!

Git 72
- Some small alterations in the way the kernel is dumped, after dumping it will truncated to it's true size
Inspired by the code of Athoik as seen in: http://tinyurl.com/ofmcvuo
Thanks!

Git 71
- Openmb added support for the Miraclebox Mini plus and Micro

Git 67

Git 64

Git 62
- Added support for the HD 1200

Git 61
- Replaced the help and info buttons

Git 60
- Some fine tuning for the full HD skins

Git 59
- A first step to make the BackupSuite also useable on full HD format skins (1920*1080). 
There still has to be done some work but because of the experimental stage of the full HD skin this has, for me, a low priority at the moment.

Git 58
- Some minor changes in the code (some inspired by code of Athoik)
- Some cosmetics in the lookuptable
